# Advanced AFWall+ Work Profile Automation Script v3.1

A robust, self-managing script that extends AFWall+ with first-class Work Profile support, intelligent parallel execution handling, and automatic app sorting by custom names.

## üö® Critical Understanding: How AFWall+ Executes Scripts

**AFWall+ launches TWO instances of your custom script in parallel!** This is by design and our script handles it intelligently:

- **Instance 1:** Acquires lock ‚Üí Applies rules ‚Üí Updates uid.txt file
- **Instance 2:** Sees lock ‚Üí Applies rules only ‚Üí Exits cleanly

Both instances apply firewall rules for redundancy, but only one updates the configuration file. This prevents corruption while ensuring rules are applied quickly.

## ‚ö° Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- **Rooted Android device** (Magisk/KernelSU/SuperSU)
- **AFWall+ installed** with root granted
- **Work Profile exists** (via Island, Shelter, or native Dual Apps)
- **ADB on computer** for initial setup
- **File manager** on device (X-plore recommended - to create file edit shortcut)
- **App Manager** installed in work profile to quickly lookup application UID

### Installation (5 minutes)

#### Automatic Installation (Recommended)
```bash
# Use the included installer script:
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

# Or on Windows:
install.bat
```

#### Manual Installation
1. **Connect device** with ADB debugging enabled

2. **Create directories and push files:**
```bash
# Create config directory (user accessible)
adb shell "mkdir -p /sdcard/afw/"

# Create script directory with root
adb shell "su -c 'mkdir -p /data/local/afw/'"

# Push script to temp location first (avoids permission error)
adb push afw.sh /sdcard/afw/afw.sh.tmp

# Move to final location with root permissions
adb shell "su -c 'cp /sdcard/afw/afw.sh.tmp /data/local/afw/afw.sh'"
adb shell "su -c 'chmod 755 /data/local/afw/afw.sh'"
adb shell "rm /sdcard/afw/afw.sh.tmp"

# Push config file
adb push uid.txt /sdcard/afw/uid.txt
```

3. **Configure AFWall+:**
   - Open AFWall+ ‚Üí Menu (‚ãÆ) ‚Üí **Set custom script**
   - Enter exactly: `nohup /data/local/afw/afw.sh > /dev/null 2>&1 &`
   - Tap **OK** to save

4. **Initial run:**
   - Tap **Apply** in AFWall+ (this triggers both script instances)
   - Check Android logs for "afwall_custom" tag to verify execution

## üì± Daily Usage

### üî¥ IMPORTANT: Apply After Every Change!

**You MUST tap "Apply" in AFWall+ after editing uid.txt!** The script only runs when AFWall+ triggers it. Changes to uid.txt alone do nothing until you:
1. Edit `/sdcard/afw/uid.txt`
2. Save the file
3. **Open AFWall+ and tap Apply**

### Adding Apps - Simple Space-Delimited Format

The v3.1 format uses simple spaces - no fancy delimiters!

#### Method 1: Package Name + Custom Name (Recommended)
```
com.spotify.music Spotify Music Player
```
The script auto-detects the UID and sorts by "Spotify Music Player"

#### Method 2: Just Package Name
```
com.spotify.music
```
The script auto-generates "Spotify" as the name

#### Method 3: UID + Custom Name
```
1010444 My Special App
```
- The script auto-detects the package name
- You can lookup app UID in App Manager application or any other 
- **TIP** Work Profile package UIDs start with 1010 - easy to check if you got correct one

#### Method 4: Complete Entry
```
1010444 com.spotify.music Spotify Premium
```
Format: `UID PACKAGE CUSTOM_NAME`
- First space separates UID from package
- Second space separates package from custom name
- Everything after the second space is the custom name

### Using X-plore File Manager

**One-tap editing setup:**
1. Navigate to `/sdcard/afw/`
2. Long-press `uid.txt`
3. Select **Create Shortcut** for homescreen access
4. Edit anytime: Long-press ‚Üí **Edit Text**

## üéØ New in Version 3.1

### Space-Based Delimiters (Performance Fix)
- **Removed internal fancy delimiter** (¬ß symbol)
- **Simple space parsing** for better performance
- **6x faster parsing** - fixed performance regression
- **Extensive debug logging** to track execution time

### Debug Improvements
- **Millisecond-precision timing** for all phases
- **Per-operation logging** shows exact bottlenecks
- **PM command timing** tracks package manager calls
- **Phase-by-phase breakdown** in debug mode

### What Changed from v3.0
- Replaced `¬ß` delimiter with triple-space internally
- Fixed slow parsing that caused 6x performance degradation
- Added extensive timing logs for debugging
- Simplified field extraction using awk

## üîß Configuration File Structure

### /sdcard/afw/uid.txt Format
```
debug=0                          # Production mode
recalculate=0                    # Normal operation
sort_by=custom                   # Sort by custom names

# Your apps - simple space format!
com.android.chrome Chrome Browser
com.whatsapp WhatsApp Messenger
com.spotify.music Spotify Music Player
1010150 Auto-Detected App Name
```

### Configuration Options

| Line | Setting | Values | Description |
|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | `debug` | `0` or `1` | Enable verbose logging with timing |
| 2 | `recalculate` | `0` or `1` | Force UID refresh (for migrations) |
| 3 | `sort_by` | `custom`, `package`, `uid` | Automatic sorting method |

### Entry Format Rules
```
PACKAGE_NAME CUSTOM_NAME           # Auto-detects UID
UID CUSTOM_NAME                    # Auto-detects package
UID PACKAGE_NAME CUSTOM_NAME       # Full entry
```

**Important:**
- First space: separates UID from package (or package from name if no UID)
- Second space: separates package from custom name
- Everything after second space: custom name (can contain spaces!)

## üîÑ Understanding Script Execution

### When Scripts Run
1. **User taps Apply** in AFWall+
2. **AFWall+ launches TWO script instances** simultaneously
3. **First instance** gets lock, both apply rules
4. **Only lock holder** updates uid.txt
5. **Both instances** complete successfully

### Debug Mode Insight
Enable `debug=1` to see detailed timing information:
```
[PHASE1] Starting file parse...
[PARSE] Line 4: com.spotify.music Spotify Music
[PARSE] Extracted - UID:[] PKG:[com.spotify.music] NAME:[Spotify Music]
[PHASE1] Parse complete. Time: 45 ms
[PHASE2] Starting data augmentation...
[AUGMENT] Looking up UID for package: com.spotify.music
[AUGMENT] PM call took 234 ms
[AUGMENT] Found UID: 1010444
[PHASE2] Augmentation complete. Time: 245 ms
...
[SUMMARY]
- Total execution time: 523 ms
```

This helps identify performance bottlenecks!

## üöÄ Advanced Usage

### Performance Troubleshooting

If script runs slow, enable debug mode to see timing:

1. Edit `/sdcard/afw/uid.txt` line 1: `debug=1`
2. Run script via AFWall+ Apply
3. Check output: `adb shell "logcat -d | grep -A 100 INSTANCE"`
4. Look for slow phases:
   - **Phase 2** slow? Too many missing UIDs (add them manually)
   - **Phase 3** slow? Recalculate mode enabled (should auto-disable)
   - **Sort** slow? Too many entries (sorting is O(n log n))

### Device Migration

When moving to a new device, UIDs change but package names don't:

1. **Backup** old device: 
   ```bash
   adb pull /sdcard/afw/uid.txt uid_backup.txt
   ```

2. **Setup** new device: Run `install.sh` or `install.bat`

3. **Restore** file:
   ```bash
   adb push uid_backup.txt /sdcard/afw/uid.txt
   ```

4. **Enable recalculation**: Set line 2 to `recalculate=1`

5. **Apply**: Tap Apply in AFWall+ to refresh all UIDs

6. **Automatic reset**: Script sets `recalculate=0` after completion

### Troubleshooting

**Nothing happens after editing uid.txt:**
- Did you tap Apply in AFWall+? (Required!)
- Check logs: `adb shell "logcat -d | grep afwall_custom"`

**Script runs too slow:**
- Enable debug=1 to see timing breakdown
- Check Phase 2 timing - if >2 seconds, add UIDs manually
- Ensure recalculate=0 in normal use

**Duplicate firewall rules:**
- Normal behavior - AFWall+ manages rule deduplication
- Both script instances apply rules by design

**Lock errors in logs:**
```bash
# Remove stale lock if needed:
adb shell "rm -rf /sdcard/afw/script.lock"
```

**Apps not blocked/allowed:**
```bash
# Enable debug mode:
# Change line 1 to: debug=1
# Then tap Apply and check output
```

**Verify Work Profile:**
```bash
adb shell "pm list users"
# Should show: UserInfo{10:Work Profile:30}
```

## üìä Technical Architecture

### Execution Phases
1. **Lock Acquisition** - Atomic mkdir operation
2. **Configuration Parse** - Read uid.txt into memory
3. **Data Augmentation** - Query missing UIDs/packages via `pm`
4. **Recalculation** - Refresh UIDs if migration mode enabled
5. **Sorting** - Order entries by chosen method (default: custom names)
6. **Rule Application** - Insert iptables rules (both instances)
7. **File Update** - Write sorted, complete data (lock holder only)

### Safety Features
- **Atomic operations** prevent partial writes
- **PID tracking** validates lock ownership
- **Timeout handling** cleans stale locks
- **UID validation** prevents invalid iptables commands
- **Simple space delimiter** for reliable parsing

### Performance Optimizations
- Rules applied before file I/O
- Parallel execution for redundancy
- In-memory processing
- Efficient awk-based parsing
- Minimal pm command calls

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

- **Script location**: Keep in `/data/local/afw/` (root-protected directory)
- **Configuration**: Stored in `/sdcard/afw/` for easy editing
- **Permissions**: Script requires root for iptables access
- **Validation**: All UIDs verified before use
- **Logging**: Production mode minimizes log output
